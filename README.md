Export Cells is an MWSE mod that exports cells for visualisation, editing and testing. It is the foundation of the [Morrowind Visualisation Project](https://morrowvis.com) with a focus on accuracy. It includes a suite of functions to enable versatile exports.

Export Cells is based on [Export Sphere](https://morrowind-modding.github.io/modding-tools/3d-modeling-tools/export-sphere) and works in conjunction.
